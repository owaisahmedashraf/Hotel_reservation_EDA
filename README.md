# Hotel Reservations EDA Project

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel reservations dataset. The goal is to understand the data, identify patterns, and prepare it for further analysis or machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about hotel reservations, including details such as the number of adults and children, type of meal plan, room type reserved, lead time, arrival details, market segment, average price per room, and booking status.

## Project Structure

1. **Importing Libraries**: Essential libraries like pandas and numpy are used for data manipulation and analysis.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

3. **Exploring Data**:
   - Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
   - Checking the shape of the dataset to understand its dimensions.
   - Exploring the structure of the dataset, including data types and memory usage.

4. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculating descriptive statistics for numerical columns to understand distributions, central tendencies, and dispersion.
   - Analyzing categorical columns to understand the distribution of categories.

5. **Handling Duplicates**:
   - Identifying duplicate rows in the dataset.
   - Removing duplicates to ensure data quality.

## Encoding Techniques

The notebook utilizes various encoding techniques to handle categorical data:

- **Label Encoding**: Converting categorical labels into integer values.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Creating binary columns for each category.
